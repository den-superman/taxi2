# taxi-service
Hello!
This is my small application - taxi_service

A little about it’s functionality:
To use the app, you need to register a profile as a Driver of our Taxi_Service. After registration - you need to log in, to access app’s entire functionality. Here you also can registrate cars and their manufacturers. You can see a list of all registrated cars, drivers or manufacturers and delete any of them if needed. Logout is implemented too. After pushing "logout" button - only login with registration page will be accessable again. 
You can touch my app here: https://guarded-headland-20220.herokuapp.com/

If you want to use this app locally(IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is needed) on your device you need to set up tomcat: 
Run your project in Intelegi IDEA -> edit configuration -> add new configuration -> tomcat -> local -> fix -> <your project name>_war_exploded. 
And I recomend you to put aplication context: "/" just for your comfort.
